The process priorities in Linux are so that the lower the number, the higher the priority. Typical numbers go from 0 to 19. By default, processes start with a priority of zero. But we can change that using the nice and renice commands.

pidof command receives the process name and returns all the process IDs that have that name.

for pid in $(pidof ffmpeg); do renice 19 $pid; done

ps ax shows us all the running processes on the computer, and we'll connect the output of the command to less, to be able to scroll through it.

locate command to locate a files directory . 
locate static/001.webm

running one ffmpeg process at a time.
for pid in $(pidof ffmpeg); 
    do while kill -CONT $pid;
        do sleep 1;
        done; 
    done
