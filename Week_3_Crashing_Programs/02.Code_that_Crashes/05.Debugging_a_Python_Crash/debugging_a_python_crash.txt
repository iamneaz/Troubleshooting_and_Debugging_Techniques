It's time to try our hand at using a Python debugger. We'll start the debugger by running pdb3 and then passing the script that we want to run and any parameters that our script needs. In our case, we'll call pdb3 update products.py new products.csv. When we start the debugger it gets positioned at the first line of our script and waits for us to tell it what to do. We could run each of the instructions in the file one by one using the next command. But there's a lot going on here. So we need to go through a lot of lines until we reach the failure. Alternatively, we can tell the debugger to continue the execution until it either finishes or crashes.
