When using Git for version control, we can use a Git command called bisect. Bisect receives two points in time in the Git history and repeatedly lets us try the code at the middle point between them until we find the commit that caused the breakage. This doesn't even need to be your Git repository. If you're using open source software that's tracking Git, you can use the bisect commit to find out which command cause the software to stop working on your computer.
