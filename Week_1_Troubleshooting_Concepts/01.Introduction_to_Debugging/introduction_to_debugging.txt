 tcpdump and Wireshark can show us ongoing network connections, and help us analyze the traffic going over our cables. Tools like ps, top, or free can show us the number and types of resources used in the system. 
 We can use a tool like strace to look at the system calls made by a program, or ltrace to look at the library calls made by the software.
