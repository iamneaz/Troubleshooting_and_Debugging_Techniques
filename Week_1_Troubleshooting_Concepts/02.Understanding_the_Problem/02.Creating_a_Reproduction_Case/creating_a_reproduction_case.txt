Reproduction case -  A wa to verify if the problem is present or not

Read logs 
- in linux => /var/log/syslog , .xsession-errors 
- in macOS => /Library/Logs
- in windows => eventViewer tools

 Lots of times, you'll find an error message that will help you understand what's going on like, unable to reach server, invalid file format, or permission denied. But what if you're unlucky, and there's no error message, or the error message is super unhelpful like internal system error. The next step is to try to isolate the conditions that trigger the issue. Do other users in the same office also experienced the problem? Does the same thing happen if the same user logs into a different computer? Does the problem happen if the applications config directory is moved away?
